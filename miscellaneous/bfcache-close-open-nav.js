/*
This JavaScript code snippet closes the mobile navigation menu if it's still open when returning to the page via the browser's back/forward cache (bfcache).
This improves UX by restoring the expected page state â€” users typically don't expect menus to remain open when going back.
Helpful for full-screen mobile menus where the selector should be tailored to your situation. 
Test carefully: if your nav includes deep category trees or filters, auto-closing might be disruptive.
