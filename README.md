## JavaScript Snippets
Here you can find JavaScript snippets related to Core Web Vitals, individual metrics, and more. These snippets can be used in your browser's DevTools.

### Changes
Core Web Vitals is continually evolving, which means the snippets and their usage might also change over time. This section includes the latest versions, and new snippets may be added in the future.
